// Over a few toy problems we will be building out a class that constructs a cart object and also includes a few methods to manipulate the data, things like adding to the cart and calculating the total.
// To start you will want to make a class called Cart that includes a constructor function. Have the constructor function take in a single parameter that will be the items in the cart. Set that value equal to a value called this.cart
// Second we will want to create a method that will take in an id and then remove the item from the cart with the matching id
// You will want to save this because we will be adding to it in the future.
//1. Clarify-why do we set it to this.cart
//2. matchID var, array to hold cart items
//3/4 use provided data
//5. constructor(items){super()???}
//6. methods: remove an item filter, findIndex
//7. create a class
    //constructor

class Cart{
    constructor(items){

    }
}
